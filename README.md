# INSE-Group-B
The Main INSE 2k16 Group Folder.

The aim of this project is to produce a Bill Splitting application that can be used by primarily university students in a shared flat/house space.
The application will be free to use which will maintain our beneficial standards so that our users (mainly students) will not have to spend any money which again will create and keep our helpful reputataion. 
Our main focus is to benefit students during their studies, making their lives easier.
The application and desktop will keep a simple design to create ease of use and will adapt to any screen resolution. 
This project is open to expansion and modification with request.
This application is in a three tier architecture which may be a complex method but will be very effective. As this makes it possible to make changes on the presentation level. Additionally we will be using a nodeJS server. 
We will also be using Java script for the desktop.
Files will be checked and moderated when changed.
